# MyWay_Open_Sources

We opensourced all the files and codes we used for development MyWay. But for communication between Unity and Arduino hardware, we used Uduino (https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/input-management/uduino-arduino-communication-simple-fast-and-stable-78402?locale=zh-CN). Please pay to get Uduino for full access of our Unity project.
