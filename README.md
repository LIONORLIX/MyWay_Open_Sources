# MyWay_Open_Sources

We have open-sourced all the files and code used for the development of MyWay. However, for the communication between Unity and Arduino hardware, we utilized Uduino, a tool that enables Arduino communication within Unity. You can acquire Uduino from the Unity Asset Store (https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/input-management/uduino-arduino-communication-simple-fast-and-stable-78402?locale=zh-CN) by making a purchase. This will provide you with full access to our Unity project.
